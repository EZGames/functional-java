/**
 * Control flow statements and expressions are those that cause code to stop
 * being completely linear, such as if, switch, or loops.
 * <p>
 * In this package are two subpackages, {@code expressions} and 
 * {@code statements}, which provide some custom control flow expressions and
 * statements, respectively.  Both packages have new {@code switch} block styles
 * as well as code inspired by Ruby's {@code unless} statement. Plus there's a
 * new {@code if} expression</p>
 * <p>
 * To read more about either, check out their packages 
 * {@link func.java.controlflow.expressions} and 
 * {@link func.java.controlflow.statements}
